# Toliss A321 (+ neo add-on)

This document gives information on the adjustment to set of Touch Portal page provided here


[Goodseb Touch Portal Pages for A32NX FBW project on Microsoft Flight Simulator]
(https://flightsim.to/file/40431/touch-portal-pages-for-flybywire-a32nx)

to X-Plane Toliss A321 (+ neo add-on).


DO NO ASK FOR THIS WORK.
I WILL NOT DISTRIBUTE IT WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION
OF THE DESIGNER OF THE ABOVE USER INTERFACES.
(Which I haven't got yet.)


# Porting

"Porting" the above pages to X-Plane and Toliss A321 required
the suppression of all actions and their replacement by the sole "Execute X-Plane Command" action
with porper parameters.

Sometimes, there is no command to change the state of a device, property, or attribute,
and "Set dataref to a value" action was used.

Linking X-Plane datarefs to a state was not difficult,
adjusting appearance of Touch Portal buttons accoriding to state values was not difficult either
altough sometimes tedious.


# Adjustments

## TCAS / ATC Panels Adjustments

This was done to practice user interface adjustment and design.


## Throttle Adjustments

In a first release, the throttle levers were simplified as follow:

- They both move synchronized, the value displayed in the user interface
is the average of the two positions.
- Throttle lever positions are clamped to Airbus positions: TOGA, MCT/FLX,
CLIMB, IDLE, and REV (respectively 100, 80, 70, 0, and -100).

Pressing a position on the lever bar/cursor adjust the position of both
throttle levers to the value. (Which is sufficient in normal operations.)


# Acknowlegment

The start of the project with undoubly the quality of the user interface
provided by
[Goodseb Touch Portal Pages for A32NX FBW project on Microsoft Flight Simulator]
(https://flightsim.to/file/40431/touch-portal-pages-for-flybywire-a32nx).


Finding commands and attribute values for states would not have been possible
without the [DatarefTool](https://datareftool.com).
(I would have appreciated a little extra help from Toliss development team.)

The project is entirely coded in python thanks to the following projects:

 - [Touch Portal API and SDK for Python](https://github.com/KillerBOSS2019/TouchPortal-API) and its related
 [Touch Portal Python Template](https://github.com/KillerBOSS2019/TouchPortal-Python-Template)
 - [XPPython3](https://xppython3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

and Austin Meyer and Guido van Rossum, of course.
